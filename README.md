GMLFlip is a tool developed with Processing (http://processing.org)
for the Graffiti Research Lab France (http://graffitiresearchlab.fr)

It allows you to draw graffiti, freely or guided by a background picture
dragged & dropped in the drawing area.
You can then save it as images that you can use to make flip books or
just save your drawing as a GML file.

GMLFlip uses the sDrop and GML4U libraries.
